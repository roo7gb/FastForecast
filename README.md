# FastForecast

This web-based application will allow for several statistical processes on time series data. The base data sets will be based around pollutants
and the Air Quality Index. Due to the fact that these data sets are somewhat difficult to forecast, there will be the option to add more
'forecastable' time series data.

This project is made as the group term project for CPSC475-020 Database Management at the University of Akron, Fall 2025.
